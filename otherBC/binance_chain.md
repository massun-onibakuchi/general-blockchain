## What is the native coin on Binance Chain?

The Binance Coin, BNB, is the native asset on Binance Chain. There are 200MM BNB coins in total. There will be no mining. The existing coin burns and freezes will still be in effect on the new Binance Chain blockchain.

The exact number of BNB coins will be destroyed based on the same number of BNB ERC20 tokens that have already been destroyed.

Since Binance Chain is live, all BNB ERC20 tokens will be swapped for Binance Chain coins. All users who hold BNB ERC20 tokens can deposit them to Binance.com, and upon withdrawal, the new Binance Chain native coins will be sent to their new wallets.

EthereumのBCでBNBはERC20として発行されている．バイナンスチェーンではネイティブコインとしてBNBを使うが，それぞれのチェーンで同量の額を交換できる．
